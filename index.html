              I’ve never been one to take facts at face value, which is why I’ve always been drawn to analytics -- my well-known curiosity nudges me to keep digging to find that great insight in the dataset or that elusive bug in the code.

              I am a Data Analytics Manager at EducationSuperHighway, a non-profit organization that operates like a start-up -- we are data-driven and prioritize technology to maximize our impact. As a manager, I blend the stories told by our data with the expertise from across our organization to create insights that power change.
            </p>
            <p class="bio-text">
              In the past five years at EducationSuperHighway as both a manager and a data analyst, I improved data transparency at the FCC by using their school broadband data to create new, insightful metrics that had been otherwise impossible for other organizations to calculate. Additionally, I retained the majority of our analysis team through the final years of our organization’s existence by ensuring they had the growth opportunities they deserve to help make a positive impact in their future endeavors.
            </p>
            <p class="bio-text">
              I love to chat! In early 2020, I’ll be available for new opportunities. My dream is to build a new “insights creation machine” which provides data-driven insights that create a positive impact in the community.
