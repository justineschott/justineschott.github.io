          I’ve never been one to take facts at face value, which is why I’ve
          always been drawn to analytics -- my well-known curiosity nudges me to
          keep digging to find that great insight in the dataset or that elusive
          bug in the code.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-text">
          I am a Data Analytics Manager at EducationSuperHighway, a non-profit
          organization that operates like a start-up -- we are data-driven and
          prioritize technology to maximize our impact. As a manager, I blend
          the stories told by our data with the expertise from across our
          organization to create insights that power change.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-text">
          In the past five years at EducationSuperHighway as both a manager and
          a data analyst, I improved data transparency at the FCC by using their
          school broadband data to create new, insightful metrics that had been
          otherwise impossible for other organizations to calculate.
          Additionally, I retained the majority of our analysis team through the
          final years of our organization’s existence by ensuring they had the
          growth opportunities they deserve to help make a positive impact in
          their future endeavors.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-text">
          I love to chat! In early 2020, I’ll be available for new
          opportunities. My dream is to build a new “insights creation machine”
          which provides data-driven insights that create a positive impact in
          the community.
